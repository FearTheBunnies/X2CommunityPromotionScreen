Compatibility note:
IgnoreClassNames is not taken into account.
Running CPS alongside workshop NPSBD, is possible, but not recommended. It would be redundant anyway, because CPS includes all of NPSBD's functionality and more.
Also, if NPSBD is updated in the future, or you're running your own modified and recompiled version of NPSBD, you might experience crashes and other issues.
