[b]Community Promotion Screen[/b] is an expanded and improved version of the [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1124609091]New Promotion Screen By Default[/url][/b]. 

It replaces the standard soldier promotion screen with a modified version of the "Faction Hero" promotion screen that was added in War of the Chosen.

All mods that require [b]New Promotion Screen By Default[/b] can be used with the Community Promotion Screen instead.

Technically, Community Promotion Screen can be used together with [b]New Promotion Screen By Default[/b], but then the [b]New Promotion Screen By Default[/b] will be simply quietly disabled and will not do anything.

[h1]FEATURES[/h1]
[list]
[*] [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=667104300][WotC] Mod Config Menu[/url][/b] support.
[*] Improved controller support.
[*] Added and documented multiple events for other mods to interact with.
[*] Custom ability point cost can now be configured for all soldier classes at the same time. Class-specific cost still takes priority.
[*] Added localization for SPARK ability row titles in all languages; in a way that will not interfere with mods adding their own localization for them.
[*] "More info" yellow question mark icon will be shown for [i]all[/i] revealed abilities, not just the ones on the current rank or lower.
[*] Support mutually exclusive abilities setup on ability templates.
[/list]

[h1]BUGFIXES[/h1]
[list]
[*] Scrollbar no longer gets misplaced when in windowed mode.
[*] "Promotion available" banner no longer displays if the soldier can't actually unlock any new perks.

Thank you for using the Community Promotion Screen. Our objective is to support all modmakers to be all they can be, so if you have suggestions please let us know. The Community Promotion Screen will try to preserve vanilla behaviour as much as possible besides literal bugfixes; behavioral changes will have to be gated behind configuration or runtime flags.
